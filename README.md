CtrlEnterTray
=============

Shortcut Phrases and Count key press of Ctrl+Enter (usually to post message) for BBS or IM.

Note :<br/>
1. Edit the predefined phrases in "phrases.ini". Use Ctrl + Up/Down/Left/Right to choose a phrase in some input area.<br/>
2. Launch the program with a string argument which will be used as the window filter keyword for counting Ctrl + Enter.<br/>
3. Set the target count of replies and thus will get a "Mission Complete" message instead of "Reply + 1" when reaching the target count.
